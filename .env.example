# ── Site Password ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Required. Password-protects the entire site via middleware.
# Set this in your Vercel environment variables for production.
# The server returns 503 if this variable is absent (fail-closed, not fail-open).
#
# Example:
SITE_PASSWORD=your-password-here


# ── Case Study Links ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Controls which case study pages are linked from popovers and margin
# annotations. Filtering happens server-side, so disabled links are never
# sent to the client.
#
# Value: comma-separated list of case study slugs (the path segment after the
# leading slash). Matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant.
#
# Omit the variable or leave it empty to hide all links (default).
# Useful while pages are still being authored.
#
# Available slugs:
#   two-way-tv     → /two-way-tv
#
# Examples:
#
#   Hide all (default — pages still being authored):
#   CASE_STUDY_LINKS=
#
#   One page ready:
#   CASE_STUDY_LINKS=two-way-tv
#
#   Multiple pages ready:
#   CASE_STUDY_LINKS=two-way-tv,another-slug
#
CASE_STUDY_LINKS=
