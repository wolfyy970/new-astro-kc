    I inherited a nascent UX team at SunTrust with no research function and no
    independent design voice. I scaled it to a 30-person multidisciplinary
    organization covering Consumer, Small Business, Wealth Management, and
    Commercial Banking. I rebooted the SunTrust Innovation Accelerator
    Studio—introducing strategic foresight and presenting future-of-banking
    scenarios to the C-Suite that informed merger strategy. When the $66B merger
    with BB&T created Truist, I led the UX methodology and design execution for
    business and commercial banking across the newly merged entity.
