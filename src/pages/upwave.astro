    Upwave was Turner's IoT-driven digital health venture, exploring the
    intersection of quantified-self data and personalized content. As Vice
    President, Product & UX, I led the specialized teams responsible for taking
    the venture from concept to market. Partnering with IDEO for initial market
    validation, I established the product strategy and introduced a lean
    methodology that enabled daily release cycles, accelerating growth to 1M
    monthly unique users in just eight months.
