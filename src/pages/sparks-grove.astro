    As UX Practice Leader for Sparks Grove (North Highland's innovation agency),
    I led the strategic consulting engagement for the Delta News Hub. Delta's
    internal and external communications lived across fragmented legacy systems.
    I directed our agency teams to architect a unified platform serving
    corporate comms, media relations, and 90,000 employees under one cohesive,
    premium experience.

      description='The Delta engagement represented just one key aspect of my purview. As Practice Leader, I transformed the agency itself from a traditional waterfall model to agile software development and lean product management, repositioning the entire practice around "Human Experience Design" (HxD). Over 2.5 years, I pitched and won $4.7M+ in new business and provided product methodology coaching for executives at major Fortune 500s, including The Home Depot. This transformation earned the National Impact Award in 2016.'
