## EDUCATION

### Executive MBA | 2019
**Brown University** (Providence, RI) & **IE Business School** (Madrid, Spain)
- Joint program
- Focus: Strategic management, innovation, global business

### M.Sc. Human-Centered Computing Systems (HCI) | 1993–1994
**University of Sussex**, Brighton, UK
- Focus: AI and Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Achievement: Apple Design Project Award winner (Problem Analysis) — international inter-university competition

### B.Sc. (Hons) Computer Science (2:1) | 1989–1993
**University of Brighton**, Brighton, UK

**Dissertation:** "Colonizing Cyberspace" — 3D visualization of internet information spaces (March 1993)

**Key quotes from dissertation:**
> *"Cyberspace has been hailed as a new technological frontier... a world spanning network connecting millions of users in the same virtual space where they could communicate and exchange information."*

> *"I believe, optimistically, that Gibsonian cyberspace, with a host of other virtual worlds for business and leisure will one day be a reality."*

**Critical timing context:**
- Dissertation completed: **March 1993**
- Mosaic browser publicly announced: **April 21, 1993** (one month LATER)
- You were writing about the internet's transformative potential before the browser that made it mainstream even existed

**Prescient concepts in dissertation:**
- Predicted importance of global networked information spaces
- Described 3D information visualization (now "spatial computing" — Apple Vision Pro, etc.)
- Anticipated virtual communities and their cultural impact
- Discussed the "Information Visualizer" — essentially predicting modern data visualization tools

**Technical Project:** Back Propagation in HyperCard
- Added external commands (XCMDs) to HyperCard's HyperScript language
- Enabled back propagation learning capabilities for user-defined tasks
- Back propagation is foundational to modern artificial neural networks
- **Origin story:** Technical AI/ML roots dating back to undergraduate work

**Narrative value:** Both projects demonstrate early foresight — predicting internet importance before the web went mainstream, and working on neural network fundamentals decades before the current AI wave. This is not hindsight; this is documented, timestamped foresight.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

---

### GENUINE PARTS COMPANY (GPC) | Atlanta, GA
**Head of UX Design and Research**  
*January 2023 – Present*

**Context:** Fortune Global 500 automotive/industrial parts distribution leader. $23B revenue. Report directly to CIO.

**Organizational Transformation:**
- Inherited 8-person team in January 2023
- Scaled to 30-person team
- Significant team quality improvements — many original team members transitioned out
- Remit: Transform nascent design capability into enterprise-grade function

**What Was Wrong (Inherited State):**
- No design system
- No UI team
- Wrong people — skills gaps across the board
- Design had no independent voice — business/product dictated solutions
- No research capability to speak of

**Team Composition (Current):**
- 30-person multidisciplinary team
- **Functions built:** UX Design, UI Design, UX Research, Design Engineering (front-end engineers)
- Geographic split: 20 onshore (Atlanta), 10 offshore (Krakow, Poland — GPC Global Technology Center)
- Krakow center established by CIO; KC hired into it

**Operating Model:**
- **Balanced team model** — dedicated UX/UI designers and research per scrum team
- Typically half a researcher per team
- Design owns design decisions; business/product owns problem statements and success metrics

**Budget:** ~$6M annually (headcount + software/tools)

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Unified Commerce Platform Redesign**
   - Leading research-driven redesign of $8B ecommerce platform
   - **Revenue impact: $30.2 million** (homepage redesign, fiscal year 2025)
   - Measurement: Rigorous A/B testing and cohort analysis with full attribution methodology
   - Have all receipts and documentation on measurement approach
   - For resumes, use "$30M+" as the rounded figure

   **The "Ways of Finding" Strategy:**
   - Two years of research led to key insight: B2B parts lookup ≠ traditional ecommerce
   - Service advisors often have the part in hand; need to identify it, not "shop" for it
   - Introduced "ways of finding" concept — multiple paths to the same part:
     - Category search
     - Part number lookup
     - Job type (what job are you doing?)
     - Legacy PDF catalogs
     - Future: diagrams/visual lookup
   - This research-driven strategy was the foundation of the $30M impact

2. **Internal Startup Support**
   - Leading design for an internal startup within GPC
   - **Highly confidential / stealth** — limited public discussion
   - Can say: Utilizes AI and machine learning, aimed at revolutionizing repair shop management
   - This venture originated from the strategic foresight work I conducted during my consulting engagement on the future of auto care
   - Important connection: Consulting work → GPC hired me → Now executing that vision
   - **Role:** Design Manager leads day-to-day; KC is hands-on + advisory, increasingly hands-on over time
   - **Agentic UI:** Designing user interfaces for agentic AI systems — the 30-year through-line from 1993 back-propagation work continues

3. **Design System ("Bolt")**
   - Built from scratch — did not inherit a design system
   - Design engineering team (front-end engineers) owns technical implementation
   - Adopted across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific
   - Reduced front-end development time by ~25%

4. **AI Design Tool Adoption**
   - Early adopter of AI design tools: v0, Cursor, Claude Code
   - Integrated into enterprise workflows
   - Purpose: Accelerate team exploration capacity and prototyping speed

5. **Organizational Positioning**
   - Established design and research as strategic function
   - Direct CIO reporting relationship
   - Elevated UX from service function to business-critical capability

**Hardest Moment / Key Conflict:**
- Had to establish design's independent voice — "told business and engineering to fuck off" (internal framing)
- **The principle:** Business/product defines problem statements and success metrics; design owns the solution
- Major conflict with Head of Business who was opinionated about what designs should be
- Resolution: Earned trust through results over time; $30M impact validated the approach
- **Lesson:** Establishing design maturity requires political will to claim responsibility for design decisions

**What NOT to claim:**
- Not running "product innovation" — running design
- The internal startup is one part of broader responsibilities, not the whole job

### TRUIST (Formerly SunTrust) | Atlanta, GA
**Senior Vice President, UX Design & Research**  
*July 2017 – June 2021*

**Context:** Regional banking leader. Led through $66B SunTrust-BB&T merger (largest banking merger since 2008).

**Organizational Transformation:**
- Inherited 10-person team — UX design only
- No UI design function
- No UX research function
- Scaled to 30-person team during merger
- Remit: Transform nascent design capability into enterprise-grade function
- Established evidence-based design methodology (same philosophy as GPC)

**Budget:** ~$7M annually (headcount + tools)

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Accelerator Studio (NOT "Innovation Studio")**
   - Did NOT found it — rebooted and re-pivoted it
   - **Inherited state:** Had done some interesting work, but future was in question
   - **My approach:** 
     - Met with all executive stakeholders
     - Interviewed them on what they thought it was and what value they wanted
     - Rebooted based on their input + my additions
   - **Two major additions I introduced:**
     1. Customer journeys
     2. Strategic foresight
   - This repositioning led to partnership with Corporate Strategy

2. **Strategic Foresight & Merger Influence**
   - Pitched Corporate Strategy on strategic foresight capabilities; they bought in and partnered
   - Co-designed and ran a foresight exercise with Accelerator Studio team
   - Pulled brightest people from all business units to participate
   
   **Methodology (the clever part):**
   - Used Jobs to Be Done framework applied to BUSINESS UNITS, not just products
   - Isolated business identity from what it thinks it is → to the problems it actually solves for customers
   - Then ran foresight exercises on how those problems would be solved by businesses in the future
   - Output: Three scenarios for the future of banking
   
   **The Presentation:**
   - Presented the three scenarios to the CEO and C-suite
   - Very well received
   - **CEO (current Truist CEO) said the work was "instrumental" in how he thought about the merger**
   
   **Credit/Politics:**
   - Boss and head of Accelerator Studio took credit for it
   - "Success has a thousand fathers"
   - But the impetus, methodology, and design of the exercise was KC's — can defend this in detail

3. **Blockchain/DeFi Exploration**
   - Explored blockchain and decentralized finance as emerging technologies
   - Part of Accelerator Studio work
   - Context: Understanding how these technologies might impact banking business models

4. **Service Design Practice**
   - Founded the Service Design practice (this one I DID found)
   - Purpose: Drive journey-based transformation across products and channels

5. **Product Rebuilds**
   - Rebuilt Commercial Banking applications for merged entity
   - Rebuilt Small Business applications
   - Rebuilt Investment Banking applications

6. **SAFe Integration**
   - Integrated voice of the customer through design and research into Scaled Agile Framework
   - NOT "innovation methodologies" — specifically design and research / voice of customer
   - Purpose: Modernize bank's software development lifecycle

**What NOT to claim:**
- Did not "found" the Innovation/Accelerator Studio — rebooted it
- Did not integrate "innovation methodologies" into SAFe — integrated voice of customer through design/research

**Exit Context:**
- Was positioned to be the design leader of the entire merged organization
- However, design function fell under legacy BB&T leadership structure
- New leader hired above me — no career path forward
- Retained through merger with bonus to ensure design capability continuity
- Left on good terms after merger integration completed
- Transitioned directly into consulting (no gap) — had existing relationships from Sparks Grove era
- Had an engineering partner for consulting business

### TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM (Time Warner) | Atlanta, GA
*Total Tenure: April 2005 – March 2014 (9 years)*

---

#### VP, Product Development (upwave.com)
*October 2012 – March 2014*

**Context:** Digital health/wellness startup within Turner. Internal venture.

**What It Actually Was:**
- IoT-driven digital health venture
- Intersection of quantified-self technologies (wearables, health trackers) and personalized content delivery
- Goal: Behavior change through data-driven insights and personalized content/tasks

**Key Metrics:**
- Grew from zero to 1 million average monthly uniques in 8 months
- 27K registered users
- 9.5M visits in first 8 months
- Increased site recirculation from 5% to 24%

**Methodology:**
- Partnered with IDEO on market validation and product-market fit
- Introduced lean product management / balanced team methodology

## KEY STORIES FOR INTERVIEWS

### 0. The Origin Story (University, 1989-1993)
- **Back propagation project:** Added neural network learning capabilities to HyperCard before AI went mainstream. Back-propagation is the foundational algorithm behind today's LLMs and neural networks.
- **"Colonizing Cyberspace" dissertation (March 1993):** Predicted internet importance through 3D information spaces
- **Critical timing:** Dissertation completed ONE MONTH before Mosaic browser was publicly announced (April 1993)
- Described concepts now called "spatial computing" (Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest)
- Predicted virtual communities and their cultural impact
- Demonstrates: Pattern of technology foresight dating back 30+ years
- **The 30-year through-line:** Started with neural networks in 1993 → Now designing agentic user interfaces at GPC. This isn't a late pivot to AI; it's a continuation.
- **Key line for interviews:** "I wrote my dissertation on the transformative potential of global networked information spaces a month before the Mosaic browser made the web mainstream. In the same year, I was building neural network tools using back-propagation, the algorithm that powers today's LLMs. I've been seeing around corners my entire career, and I'm still doing it."

---

## TALENT DEVELOPMENT

- **Andy Vitale**: Hired to my team at SunTrust → Recruited away to become Head of Design at Rocket Mortgage
- This is evidence of developing leaders who get hired into senior roles at major companies

---

## GAPS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

1. **No direct P&L ownership** — Have influenced revenue, not owned a P&L
2. **No Insurtech experience** — Banking is adjacent but not insurance
3. **Limited public thought leadership** — "Silent doer" profile
4. **Most recent pure innovation role was 2014** — upwave.com; since then in design leadership with innovation components

---

## COMPENSATION

**Current (GPC):**
- Base salary: $260,000
- Total package (including bonus + equity): $400,000+

*Note: This comp level narrows the field. Target roles need to be VP/Head-level or equivalent.*

---

## AGE / MARKET POSITIONING CONCERNS

- Aware of potential "aging out" dynamic in hiring
- Seeing it reflected in reduced interview volume
- **Counter-strategy:** Emphasize currency and forward-looking work
  - AI tool adoption (v0, Cursor, Claude Code)
  - Internal AI/ML startup
  - Recent measurable impact ($30M+ in 2025)
  - Not coasting on past wins

---

## HANDLING TOUGH QUESTIONS / REFRAMING WEAKNESSES

### "Why are you looking to leave GPC?"
**Honest answer (internal):** Relationship with boss isn't great; limited upward mobility
**Reframe:** "I've accomplished what I was brought in to do — transform a nascent design function into an enterprise capability. The team is scaled, the design system is deployed globally, and we're delivering measurable results. I'm looking for the next challenge where I can apply this playbook, ideally with a leadership team that sees design as central to business strategy."

### "You don't have P&L ownership. Why should we trust you with broader responsibility?"
**Reframe:** "I haven't owned a P&L, but I've directly influenced significant revenue — $30M in attributable impact at GPC, and foresight work that shaped a $66B merger strategy at Truist. I've managed $6-7M budgets. What I bring is the ability to translate design work into business outcomes that finance teams can validate."

### "Your most recent pure innovation role was 2014. Are you still current?"
**Reframe:** "upwave was my last full-time innovation role, but innovation has been embedded in everything since. At Truist, I rebooted the Accelerator Studio and explored blockchain/DeFi before it was mainstream. At GPC, I'm leading design for an AI/ML internal startup right now. I've also stayed hands-on with tools — I'm actively using Cursor, Claude Code, v0 in my workflow. I'm not managing from a distance."

### "Why the gap between Turner and Truist?" (Note: Actually went Turner → Sparks Grove → Truist)
**Answer:** "After Turner, I moved to Sparks Grove, a consulting firm, where I led their UX practice and won $4.7M in new business. That experience — working across Delta, Coca-Cola, Disney, Home Depot — gave me breadth I wouldn't have gotten staying in one company. Then Truist recruited me to build their design function."

### "You mention 'seeing around corners' — isn't that just luck?"
**Counter:** "It's documented. I wrote my dissertation on the internet's importance a month before Mosaic launched. I predicted mobile AR would happen on phones before the iPhone existed. I developed ACR technology years before second-screen became mainstream. You can dismiss one of those as luck. Three decades of it is a pattern. It's not magic — it's paying attention to technology trajectories and understanding what becomes possible when curves intersect."

### "What's your management philosophy?"
**Answer:** "Evidence-based design. My core principle is: 'You are not the customer, but nor am I. So I don't care about your opinion; I care about the customer's opinion.' In practice, that means: primary research to understand the problem space, design solutions based on evidence, usability testing to validate, quantitative validation where possible, and ultimately tying design work to business outcomes. That's how we got to $30M in attributable impact at GPC. For managing teams: hire smart people, give them clear problems to solve, remove obstacles, and measure outcomes, not activity."

### "Why should we hire you over someone younger/cheaper?"
**Reframe:** "You could. What you'd lose is pattern recognition — knowing what's signal and what's noise, having built this playbook twice already, having the executive presence to influence C-suite decisions. I'm also not coasting. I'm actively using AI tools in my workflow, leading an AI/ML startup, and just delivered $30M in measured impact. The question isn't whether I'm current — it's whether you want someone who's done this before or someone who's figuring it out as they go."

### "Tell me about a time you failed."
**Use the upwave story:** "upwave was a genuine failure in some ways — we built a great product, hit 1M users in 8 months, partnered with IDEO, but Turner shut it down when they exited the health vertical. The product was ahead of its time — pre-Apple Watch mainstream — and Turner's TV content wasn't strong enough to sustain it. What I learned: timing matters as much as execution, and internal ventures live or die by parent company strategy, not just product quality. It taught me to pay closer attention to organizational dynamics and strategic alignment, not just product-market fit."

## VALUE PROPOSITIONS BY ROLE TYPE

### For Design Leadership Roles (VP Design, Head of Design, CDO)
**Primary value prop:** "I transform nascent design capabilities into enterprise-grade strategic functions. I've done this twice at Fortune 500 companies — scaling teams from single digits to 30, establishing research capability, deploying design systems, and proving value in business terms ($30M+ attributable revenue)."

### For Innovation Roles (Head of Innovation, Chief Innovation Officer)
**Primary value prop:** "I've spent 30 years identifying technology shifts before they go mainstream — from predicting the internet's importance before Mosaic, to pioneering mobile AR before the iPhone, to leading AI/ML ventures today. I don't just spot trends; I build organizations to capitalize on them."

### For CDO/Transformation Roles
**Primary value prop:** "I bridge design, product, and technology. I've led digital transformation from the design seat — influencing $66B merger strategy, delivering $30M in measured revenue impact, and building functions that elevate customer experience to a strategic advantage."

## ELEVATOR PITCHES

### 30-Second Pitch (Design Leadership)
"I'm a design executive who transforms nascent UX functions into enterprise strategic capabilities. I've done this twice at Fortune 500 companies — GPC and Truist — scaling teams from single digits to 30 and delivering measurable business impact. At GPC, that meant $30 million in attributable revenue. I'm looking for my next transformation challenge."

### 30-Second Pitch (Innovation)
"I've spent 30 years identifying technology shifts before they go mainstream. I wrote my dissertation predicting the internet's importance a month before the Mosaic browser launched. I pioneered mobile AR before the iPhone. Now I'm leading design for an AI/ML startup at GPC. I see around corners — and I build organizations to capture what's coming."

## COVER LETTER BUILDING BLOCKS

### Opening Hook — Design Leadership
"Design isn't a service function — it's a strategic capability. I've spent my career proving that, twice transforming nascent UX teams into enterprise-grade functions at Fortune 500 companies. At GPC, that transformation delivered $30 million in attributable revenue."

### Opening Hook — Innovation/CDO
"I wrote my dissertation predicting the internet's transformative potential a month before the Mosaic browser made it mainstream. That wasn't luck — it was the start of a 30-year pattern of seeing technology shifts before they arrive. I'm still doing it, currently leading design for an AI/ML internal startup."

### Opening Hook — Transformation
"Twice I've inherited underperforming design functions and transformed them into strategic capabilities — at Truist during a $66B merger, and at GPC where we've delivered $30M in measured impact. I'm looking for my third transformation."

### Body Paragraph — The Transformation Pattern
"At both Truist and GPC, I inherited small teams with no research capability, no design system, and no independent voice. In both cases, I scaled to 30 people, established evidence-based design methodology, deployed global design systems, and proved value in terms finance teams could validate. This isn't theory — it's a repeatable playbook."

### Body Paragraph — The Foresight Pattern
"My track record of technology foresight is documented and timestamped. Mobile AR before the iPhone (2005-2008). ACR and second-screen before it went mainstream (2008-2012). IoT/wearables before the Apple Watch (2012-2014). Strategic foresight that shaped a $66B banking merger (2017-2021). AI/ML internal startup now. I don't follow trends — I anticipate them."

### Body Paragraph — The Business Impact
"I measure design success in business terms. At GPC, a research-driven homepage redesign delivered $30.2 million in attributable revenue — validated through A/B testing and cohort analysis with full documentation. At Truist, strategic foresight work that I designed and led was called 'instrumental' by the CEO in shaping merger strategy. Design isn't decoration — it's leverage."

### Closing — Standard
"I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience transforming design functions could contribute to [Company]'s goals. I'm particularly interested in [specific aspect of their challenge], which aligns with work I've done at [relevant example]."

### Closing — Compensation Flexibility
"I'm at a stage where the right challenge matters more than maximizing compensation. What I'm looking for is a leadership team that sees design as central to business strategy, and a transformation challenge worth solving."
