# Product Specification

KC Wolff-Ingham's portfolio is a high-impact, interactive digital presence for a senior design leader. It is designed to demonstrate both strategic depth and technical fluency.

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Resume (Home Page)
The primary landing experience is a "living" resume document.
- **Editorial Hero Section:** A clean, high-contrast introduction with smooth fade-in animations and a sharp tagline: "Design leadership, product depth, and technical savvy."
- **Popovers (Hotspots):** Inline links that trigger detailed context overlays.
  - **Draggable Context:** Popovers can be moved around the screen on desktop, allowing persistent reference while reading.
  - **Focus Management:** Full keyboard support and focus trapping for an accessible experience.
  - **Integrated Close:** Consistent, easy-to-find '×' button on both desktop and mobile.
- **Scroll Annotations:** On wide screens (≥1400px), key hotspots automatically reveal themselves as margin annotations as the user scrolls, providing a rich, "magazine-style" experience.
- **Annotation Dissolve:** A refined visual effect where margin annotations gracefully disappear when their corresponding popover is opened, avoiding visual clutter and content duplication.
- **Marginalia Preview (Widen Hint):** On standard desktop screens (1024px-1399px), an elegant "Expand for Marginalia" hint appears. It signals that more content is available in a wider view.
- **High-Fidelity Highlighting:** Smooth, multi-line highlights that flow with text wrapping.

### 2. Case Studies
Deep dives into major projects, each with a custom thematic style while sharing a common layout (Truist, Sparks Grove, Upwave).

### 3. Responsive Experience
- **Desktop:** Full "magazine" layout with margin annotations and floating draggable popovers.
- **Mobile:** Optimized "bottom-sheet" popovers with frosted-glass dismiss controls for high-fidelity mobile interaction.

## Target Audience
- Executive recruiters and hiring managers.
